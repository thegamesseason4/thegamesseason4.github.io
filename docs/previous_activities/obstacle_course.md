## Description

Open call made out to any competitor wanting to test their physical and mental fortitude. Competitors went head-to-head in different heats. Contestants could go more than once, but only their first attempt would be their official time. Obstacles included competitors to show off their strength, speed, endurance, balance, ingenuity, heart, and determination to complete the course. Completion times varied from 20 minutes to over an hour from start to finish. At the end, there was a special challenge made for teams of 3 where individuals had to get across as a team where one could not hear, one could not speak, and one could not see.
