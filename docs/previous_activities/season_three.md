## Description

Contestants were asked to submit captain submissions. 3 males and 3 females were selected as captains. They were asked to recruit and complete a team of 3 males and 3 females (including themselves). The captains recruited their team and showed up ready to compete. Right before the games began, a surprise 7th team of 6 joined the game, making it a total of 42 contestants. After every challenge, there was both a male and female head to head elimination where the winner(s) rejoined the game in their prospective teams. After a long day of battles, 10 contestants attempted the final. One gladiator became victorious amongst all the other competitors.
